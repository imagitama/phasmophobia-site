# Voice Detection

Follow the steps from the developers here to get voice detection working: [https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/0/2948125678383474159](https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/0/2948125678383474159)

## My voice detection isn't working!

If you talk into the Spirit Box and you do not get a response or "Nothing Detected" then voice detection isn't working.

Ensure you have followed the steps in the link above.

Ensure the game window is focused (you have not alt-tabbed from it) and you have actually **clicked** on the game window.

In the Main Menu go to Options -> Audio and click the Test button.

## What questions can you ask

There is a very long list of all possible phrases you can ask the ghost. Try out these kinds of questions:

- "Give us a sign"
- "Are you there"
- "Turn on the lights"

**Remember that the ghost can hear you even without the Spirit Box. When it is hunting keep your voice quiet!**

### Ouija Board

There are additional questions you can ask using the Ouija Board such as:

- "What is your favourite room"
- "How old are you"

etc.

## Tips

- speak slowly and clearly to help the voice detection
- speak the ghost's name inside the building to anger it so you can find where it is
