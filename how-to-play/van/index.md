# The Van

Where all players spawn, collect items, monitor the building, read optional objectives and end the game.

## Monitor

The monitor on the desk is used to look through the portable video cameras players can set up **and** any stationary cameras in the building. Every camera has a night-vision mode.

The ghost orb evidence is shown on the monitor. Leave a spare camera next to the monitor so a player can take a photo of the ghost orb.

## Whiteboard

The whiteboard explains optional objectives that give you money if you complete them.

It explains who the ghost is so you can say their name inside the building to anger them.

It explains if the ghost responds to everyone saying their name or only 1 person alone saying their name.

## Map

There is a live map of each player, where the stationary cameras are, where the power switch is and where any sensors are placed (which can be purchased when you are higher level).

## Sanity meter

Below the map is the level of sanity of each player. When players witness ghost events and spend time in the dark it will go down. Low sanity will make the ghost more powerful.

The only way to improve sanity is to consume sanity pills which is only available at higher levels.

## Sound sensors

At a higher level you can purchase sound sensors which are reported here.

## Activity

It informs you when the ghost is active inside the building. If it is high it means the ghost is probably moving around or interacting with objects.

**If the activity is at 10 then the ghost is hunting and you cannot use the radio from the van.**

### Tips

- it is probably helpful to inform teammates of sudden jumps in activity in case it is a reaction to something they did
