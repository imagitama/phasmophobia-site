# How to Play

The objective of this game is to determine what kind of ghost is haunting the building. You do this by finding various forms of evidence and selecting them from your [Journal](#journal).

Each player spawns into a ghost hunting van loaded with equipment, sensors, a monitor and an explanation of the ghost and optional objectives.

Each player has 2 slots on their person to store items and 2 hands to carry items.

## [Setup Phase](./setup-phase)

When you open the door of the building you enter a 5 minute [setup phase](./setup-phase).

## [Hunting Mode](./hunting-mode)

After the setup phase is complete the ghost can enter [hunting mode](./hunting-mode) which means it can try and kill you.

## [Van](./van)

Each player spawns, monitors the building and players and more from the [van](./van).

## [Journal](./journal)

Each player has a [journal](./journal) to learn about the game and to complete it.

## Ending the round

Each player needs to select the evidence and the ghost type to ensure you get full EXP and money.

Then any player presses the keypad inside the van to end the round.

**You cannot end the game unless everyone is inside the van.**

## [Evidence](/evidence)

To win the game you must discover [evidence](/evidence).

## [Sanity](./sanity)

When you are in the dark or see a ghost your [sanity](./sanity) will drop.

## Ghost Events

An optional objective is to witness a ghost event. It can be one of the following:

- seeing the ghost
- hearing the ghost walking or its voice
- seeing the ghost's footprints
- watching someone else die

## Bones

They give EXP for taking a photo of the bones and for picking them up. No other benefits.

They also (probably) give you money for picking them up (to be confirmed)

## Death

If you die you will lose all of the items you added to the mission but your insurance will cover 50% of the value of the items.

For example if you spend $100 on a motion sensor, you bring it on a mission then you die, at the end of the mission you will lose the sensor but you will be given $50.
