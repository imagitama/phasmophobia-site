# Setup Phase

**Duration: 5 minutes (amateur difficulty)**

When your team is ready, pick up the main door key on the desk and open the front door. This starts a 5 minute timer (which is reduced at harder difficulties).

Use the Setup Phase to determine where the ghost is:

- look for cold breath in a room or hallway
- use the EMF Reader which shows you recent ghost activity
- speak its name loudly
- place candles and watch if they blow out
- search for fingerprints on doors, windows and light switches

After the 5 minutes ends, the ghost will be able to enter [hunting mode](../hunting-mode) which can kill players.
