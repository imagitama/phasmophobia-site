# Hunting Mode

The hunting mode is when the ghost tries to kill a single player. It only happens after [Setup Phase](../setup-phase).

## When does it start

**Start Duration: 8 seconds**

You are safe for the first 8 seconds of the hunt.

Your flashlights will start to flicker and the house lights will flicker. The front door will lock for the duration of the hunt.

After that initial flickering, the ghost will start to move inside the house to kill a player. Your flashlights will flicker for the duration of the hunt.

**During the hunt the radio on your shoulder does not work at all.**

## How to hide

- hide inside a closet or locker
- hide inside a room and close the door
- burn a Smudge Stick when the ghost is near you to give yourself more time to hide

## When does it end

When the flashlight and houselights stop flickering the hunt is over.

## Notes

- the ghost can start hunting anywhere in the building but has an 80% chance to start from the room they are haunting

## Tips

- identify lockers and closets during the setup phase
- make note of any rooms you can hide in while walking around
- carry a Smudge Stick with you to delay the ghost killing you

  - The chance for a most ghosts to begin hunting is based on the average sanity of all players in the lobby then by a die roll* (still being investigated)
  
  *The die roll is a random number generated from a range which is specific to each kind of action. For some actions the rolls may be 25% chance, where others have <10% chance.
