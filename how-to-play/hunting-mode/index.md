# Hunting Mode

**Duration: 8 seconds**

The hunting mode is when the ghost tries to kill a single player. It only happens after [Setup Phase](../setup-phase).

## When does it start

Your flashlights will flicker and the house lights will flicker for 8 seconds. The front door will lock for the duration of the hunt.

After that initial flickering, the ghost will start to move inside the house to kill a player. Your flashlights will flicker for the duration of the hunt.

**During the hunt the radio on your shoulder does not work at all.**

## How to hide

- hide inside a closet or locker
- hide inside a room and close the door
- burn a Smudge Stick when the ghost is near you to give yourself more time to hide

## When does it end

When the flashlight and houselights stop flickering the hunt is over.

## Notes

- the ghost can start hunting anywhere in the building but has an 80% chance to start from the room they are haunting

## Tips

- identify lockers and closets during the setup phase
- make note of any rooms you can hide in while walking around
- carry a Smudge Stick with you to delay the ghost killing you
