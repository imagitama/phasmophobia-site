# Hunting Mode

When the ghost wants to try to kill you, it enters a hunting mode. Your flashlights will flicker and the house lights will flicker for approximately 8 seconds. The front door will lock for the duration of the hunt.

After that, it will move through the house and if it is near you, could try and kill you!

**During the hunt the radio on your shoulder does not work at all.**

## How to hide

- hide inside a closet or locker
- hide inside a room and close the door
- burn a Smudge Stick when the ghost is near you to give yourself more time to hide

## When does the hunt end

When the lights stop flickering then the hunt is over.

## Notes

- the ghost can start hunting anywhere in the building but has an 80% chance to start from the room they are haunting

## Tips

- identify lockers and closets during the setup phase
- make note of any rooms you can hide in while walking around
- carry a Smudge Stick with you to delay the ghost killing you
