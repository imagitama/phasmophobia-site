# Asylum

**Size: Large**

**Unlocks: Level 3**

An abandoned mental hospital. It is the largest map and has 2 floors connected by 2 staircases.

## Tips

- in the setup phase split up to each corner of the building to search for the ghost room
- one way to find the ghost during setup is to ask the ghost to "give you a sign" while walking around and look for open doors and turned on lights
