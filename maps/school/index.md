An abandoned highschool with 2 floors.

## Tips

- during setup, split up and go to the corners of the building to quickly find the ghost's room
- to find the ghost quicker try walking through the building and "ask for a sign" from the ghost and look for open doors and lights turned on
- it does not have lockers or cupboards to hide, so you must find a room and close the door to hide
