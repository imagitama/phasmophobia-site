# Ouija Board

An item that can sometimes be found in each of the maps. It is usually hidden in a basement or on a shelf somewhere.

**Using the Ouija Board will drastically drop your sanity!**

## What can I ask it?

You are talking with the ghost so you can ask questions about it such as:

- "What is your favorite room?" (can tell you which room it is haunting)
- "How old are you?"
- "Who killed you?"
- "How long have you been here?"

## Demons

If the ghost is a Demon, when you ask questions of the Ouija Board it will not drop your sanity.
