# Crucifix

**Range: 3 meters (5 meters for Banshee)**

**Usages: 2** (it disappears after)

The crucifix is used to reduce the chances of a hunt if placed in the room of the ghost.

The Banshee ghost dislikes the crucifix so it can protect the user from being attacked if held in their hand or on their belt.

## Preventing a hunt

When you find the room the ghost is haunting, place the crucifix in the middle of it on the floor to prevent it from hunting.

**Make sure it is in the middle of the room!** It has a small range so if you place it on one side of the room there is a chance the ghost will spawn on the opposite side and still hunt.

## Tips

- if you have a spare slot and there is one already in the ghost's room, leave it on your belt
- if the ghost is avoiding you so you cannot complete objectives it might be afraid of your crucifix
- ensure the Crucifix is in the middle of the room as the range is low
