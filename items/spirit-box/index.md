# Spirit Box

**Evidence: Yes**

This item is used to talk to the ghost. Turn it on and ask it questions like "are you there" and if it gives you a 1 word answer like "kill" or "yes" or "die" or something then you have found that evidence.

**The lights must be off and you must either be near the ghost or be in the ghost's room to get a response.**

**You do not need to take a photo of the Spirit Box for the evidence to count.**

## Notes

It (probably) still detects your voice even when push to talk is enabled and you aren't talking (to be confirmed).

## What should I ask it?

Technically it can give you hints about itself and what to do to defeat it however in most cases just getting a response is enough. You can leave the Spirit Box anywhere and move on with the game.

You can ask it a variety of questions such as:

- "Are you there?"
- "Can we leave?"
- "Give us a sign"

## With voice detection

You can test if your voice detection is working by turning on the spirit box and asking "are you there". If it the ghost responds or says "Nothing Detected" on the device then it is working.

You can verify your voice detection is working by going to Main Menu -> Options -> Audio and clicking the Test button.

**Ensure you have not alt-tabbed from the game and that you have clicked on the game window so that voice detection works!**

## Without voice detection

Say anything into your mic and (if the ghost heard you) it will give you a random response
