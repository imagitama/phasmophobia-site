# Video Camera

A camera that can be placed anywhere and what it captures can be seen on the monitor in the truck.

It is the only way to complete the Ghost Orb evidence.

## Notes

- the only thing you can take a photo of through the video camera are ghost orbs (ie you cannot take a photo of the ghost)

## Tips

- place it in the ghost's room with video of the EMF Reader and Ghost Writing Book to remotely get the evidence
- only take it into the building when you have located the ghost's room so you have extra slots for other items
- place it on a Tripod for better vision
- carry it on your hip to help someone in the truck help you
