## General

### When does the timer start?

When you open the front door of the building.

### How do I end the game?

One person must enter the 3 forms of evidence, select the ghost then use the keypad in the van.

### Can I die in the van?

Technically yes but it is very very very unlikely.

### Can I die outside the building?

Yes if you just moved outside and the ghost thinks you are still inside. The ghost is designed not to move outside.

### How often does the ghost hunt?

It is a combination of chance and an average of all player's sanity.

### How do I turn off the car alarm?

Pick up the car key somewhere in the house (usually at the front door in a bowl) and use it on the driver's side door of the car.

### How do I find the Ouija Board?

It has a chance to spawn on any map and is not guaranteed. They are hidden in garages or cabinets. Using the board will drop your sanity very quickly!

### What happens if I incorrectly guess the ghost?

You will not gain any money or EXP.

## Items

### Why did my items disappear in the lobby?

When you die you lose all of the items you added to the lobby you died in. Any items you did not add should not be lost.

## Controls

No.
