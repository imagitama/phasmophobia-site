# Evidence

Each ghost can be identified by evidence.

ðŸ“¸ = requires a photograph

## Fingerprints ðŸ“¸

When a ghost interacts with an object such as a door or window it _might_ leave a handprint on the object. Use the UV Light or the glowstick to find them then take a photo.

**Footprints do not count.**

## Ghost Orb ðŸ“¸

When a video camera or CCTV camera is aimed at or in the room the ghost is haunting, there is the possibility that a small orb will move in the camera. Take a photo of the orb to capture the evidence.

Tips:

- Leave a spare photo camera inside the van to capture this

## Freezing Temperatures

If you talk through your microphone and cold air comes out from your mouth it means the room has freezing temperatures which is a form of evidence.

Tips:

- An entire hall and some side rooms could have freezing temperatures
- The thermometer is not required to detect this

## Ghost Writing Book

If you place the Ghost Writing Book in the room the ghost is haunting it could write words into it like "kill kill kill" or even symbols. It should not be blank to be a form of evidence.

Tips:

- Prop the book against a wall and point the video camera at it to check this evidence from the van

## EMF Reader

If the EMF Reader goes up to the maximum level (5) then it is a form of evidence.

Tips:

- Prop the book against a wall and point the video camera at it to check this evidence from the van
