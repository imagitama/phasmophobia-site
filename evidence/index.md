# Evidence

Each ghost can be identified by evidence.

ðŸ“¸ = requires a photograph

## Fingerprints ðŸ“¸

When a ghost interacts with an object such as a door or window it _might_ leave a handprint on the object. Use the UV Light or the glowstick to find them then take a photo.

**Footprints do not count.**

## Ghost Orb ðŸ“¸

When a [video camera](../items/video-camera) or CCTV camera is aimed at or in the room the ghost is haunting, there is the possibility that a small orb or insect will move in the camera. Take a photo of the orb to capture the evidence.

Tips:

- Leave a spare photo camera inside the van to capture this

## Freezing Temperatures

If you talk through your microphone and cold air comes out from your mouth it means the room has freezing temperatures which is a form of evidence.

Tips:

- An entire hall and some side rooms could have freezing temperatures
- The thermometer is not required to detect this
